# v1.19

Version 1.19 of Medusa ships performance improvements, bug fixes, and some breaking changes.

<DocCard item={{

  label: 'Release Notes',
  customProps: {
    iconName: "github",

  }
}} />

## Breaking Changes

### Change in Cart-Completion Strategy Response

In previous versions, if you attempt to complete a cart that's already completed, you will receive a response with status code`409`, indicating a conflict.

In v1.19 of the Medusa backend, the order or swap associated with the completed cart is returned instead with status code 200:

```
// completing a regular cart
{
  response_code: 200,
  response_body: { data: order, type: "order" },
}

// completing a swap cart
{
  response_code: 200,
  response_body: { data: swap, type: "swap" },
}
```

### Replaced node-redis with ioredis

In previous versions, the Medusa backend used `node-redis` to manage the Express session store.

In v1.19, `node-redis` is replaced with `ioredis` for higher configurability of the Redis client used for session management, and to make Redis configurations consistent with Redis modules (such as the Redis Event or Cache modules) which use `ioredis`.

## How to Update

Run the following command in your project:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @medusajs/medusa@1.19
```

To avoid unexpected issues with dependencies, it's also recommended to update all other Medusa plugins or packages you have installed.
