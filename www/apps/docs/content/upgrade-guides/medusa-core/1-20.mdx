# v1.20

Version 1.20 of Medusa ships performance improvements, bug fixes, and some breaking changes.

## Breaking Changes

### Stripe Plugin Changes

v6.0.7 of the Stripe plugin introduces improvements and breaking changes. Refer to [its upgrade guide](../plugins/stripe/6-0-7.md) for more details on the breaking changes, required actions, and how to update it.

### Service Registration Improvement

Previously, when you create services such as a Payment Processor or Fulfillment Provider, the Medusa backend relied on the use of the `instanceof` operator to check and register a service:

```ts
// previously
export function isPaymentProcessor(obj: unknown): boolean {
  return obj instanceof AbstractPaymentProcessor
}
```

However, if you have a version mismatch in your packages, the `instanceof` check will fail even though the services are seemingly the expected type.

In this release, the service class type checks are now performed with static properties to eliminate this issue:

<!-- eslint-skip -->

```ts
// now
static isPaymentProcessor(object): boolean {
    return object?.constructor?._isPaymentProcessor
}
```

This change doesn't require any action from your side.

## How to Update

Run the following command in your Medusa backend:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @medusajs/medusa@1.20
```

To avoid unexpected issues with dependencies, it's also recommended to update all other Medusa plugins or packages you have installed.
