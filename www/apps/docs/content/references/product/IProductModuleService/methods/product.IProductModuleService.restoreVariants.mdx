provided in a product's details passed to the [update](product.IProductModuleService.update.mdx) method.

## Example

```ts
import {
  initialize as initializeProductModule,
} from "@medusajs/product"

async function restoreProductVariants (ids: string[]) {
  const productModule = await initializeProductModule()

  await productModule.restoreVariants(ids)
}
```
