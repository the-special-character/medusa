# ConfigModule

The configurations for your Medusa backend are in `medusa-config.js` located in the root of your Medusa project. The configurations include database, modules, and plugin configurations, among other configurations.

`medusa-config.js` exports an object having the following properties:

- [projectConfig](medusa.ConfigModule-1.mdx#projectconfig): (required): An object that holds general configurations related to the Medusa backend, such as database or CORS configurations.
- [plugins](medusa.ConfigModule-1.mdx#plugins): An array of plugin configurations that defines what plugins are installed and optionally specifies each of their configurations.
- [modules](medusa.ConfigModule-1.mdx#modules): An object that defines what modules are installed and optionally specifies each of their configurations.
- [featureFlags](medusa.ConfigModule-1.mdx#featureflags): An object that enables or disables features guarded by a feature flag.

For example:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = {
  projectConfig,
  plugins,
  modules,
  featureFlags,
}
```

## Environment Variables

It's highly recommended to store the values of configurations in environment variables, then reference them within `medusa-config.js`.

During development, you can set your environment variables in the `.env` file at the root of your Medusa backend project. In production,
setting the environment variables depends on the hosting provider.
