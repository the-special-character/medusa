# FulfillmentService

## Overview

A fulfillment provider is the shipping provider used to fulfill orders and deliver them to customers. An example of a fulfillment provider is FedEx.

By default, a Medusa Backend has a `manual` fulfillment provider which has minimal implementation. It allows you to accept orders and fulfill them manually. However, you can integrate any fulfillment provider into Medusa, and your fulfillment provider can interact with third-party shipping providers.

A fulfillment provider is a service that extends the `AbstractFulfillmentService` and implements its methods. So, adding a fulfillment provider is as simple as creating a service file in `src/services`.
The file's name is the fulfillment provider's class name as a slug and without the word `Service`. For example, if you're creating a `MyFulfillmentService` class, the file name is `src/services/my-fulfillment.ts`.

```ts title=src/services/my-fulfillment.ts
import { AbstractFulfillmentService } from "@medusajs/medusa"

class MyFulfillmentService extends AbstractFulfillmentService {
  // methods here...
}

export default MyFulfillmentService
```

---

## Identifier Property

The `FulfillmentProvider` entity has 2 properties: `identifier` and `is_installed`. The `identifier` property in the fulfillment provider service is used when the fulfillment provider is added to the database.

The value of this property is also used to reference the fulfillment provider throughout Medusa. For example, it is used to [add a fulfillment provider](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#regions\_postregionsregionfulfillmentproviders) to a region.

```ts
class MyFulfillmentService extends AbstractFulfillmentService {
  static identifier = "my-fulfillment"

  // ...
}
```

## Methods

### getFulfillmentOptions

This method is used when retrieving the list of fulfillment options available in a region, particularly by the [List Fulfillment Options API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#regions\_getregionsregionfulfillmentoptions).
For example, if youâ€™re integrating UPS as a fulfillment provider, you might support two fulfillment options: UPS Express Shipping and UPS Access Point. Each of these options can have different data associated with them.

#### Example

```ts
class MyFulfillmentService extends AbstractFulfillmentService {
  // ...
  async getFulfillmentOptions(): Promise<any[]> {
    return [
      {
        id: "my-fulfillment",
      },
      {
        id: "my-fulfillment-dynamic",
      },
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Returns

<ParameterTypes parameters={[{"name":"Promise","type":"Promise&#60;any[]&#62;","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","description":"The list of fulfillment options. These options don't have any required format. Later on, these options can be used when creating a shipping option,\nsuch as when using the [Create Shipping Option API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#shipping-options\\_postshippingoptions). The chosen fulfillment option, which is one of the\nitems in the array returned by this method, will be set in the `data` object of the shipping option.","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"any[]","type":"`any`[]","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","description":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]}  sectionTitle="getFulfillmentOptions"/>

### validateFulfillmentData

This method is called when a shipping method is created. This typically happens when the customer chooses a shipping option during checkout, when a shipping method is created
for an order return, or in other similar cases. The shipping option and its data are validated before the shipping method is created.

You can use the provided parameters to validate the chosen shipping option. For example, you can check if the `data` object passed as a second parameter includes all data needed to
fulfill the shipment later on.

If any of the data is invalid, you can throw an error. This error will stop Medusa from creating a shipping method and the error message will be returned as a result of the API Route.

#### Example

```ts
class MyFulfillmentService extends AbstractFulfillmentService {
  // ...
  async validateFulfillmentData(
    optionData: Record<string, unknown>,
    data: Record<string, unknown>,
    cart: Cart
  ): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
    if (data.id !== "my-fulfillment") {
      throw new Error("invalid data")
    }

    return {
      ...data,
    }
  }
}
```

### validateOption

Once the admin creates the shipping option, the data of the shipping option will be validated first using this method. This method is called when the [Create Shipping Option API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#shipping-options\_postshippingoptions) is used.

#### Example

For example, you can use this method to ensure that the `id` in the `data` object is correct:

```ts
class MyFulfillmentService extends AbstractFulfillmentService {
  // ...
  async validateOption(
    data: Record<string, unknown>
  ): Promise<boolean> {
    return data.id == "my-fulfillment"
  }
}
```

#### Parameters

<ParameterTypes parameters={[{"name":"data","type":"[ShippingOptionData](../../medusa/types/medusa.ShippingOptionData.mdx)","description":"the data object that is sent in the body of the request, basically, the data object of the shipping option. You can use this data to validate the shipping option before it is saved.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}  sectionTitle="validateOption"/>

#### Returns

<ParameterTypes parameters={[{"name":"Promise","type":"Promise&#60;boolean&#62;","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","description":"Whether the fulfillment option is valid. If the returned value is false, an error is thrown and the shipping option will not be saved.","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"boolean","type":"`boolean`","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","description":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]}  sectionTitle="validateOption"/>

### canCalculate

This method is used to determine whether a shipping option is calculated dynamically or flat rate. It is called if the `price_type` of the shipping option being created is set to calculated.

#### Example

```ts
class MyFulfillmentService extends AbstractFulfillmentService {
  // ...
  async canCalculate(
    data: Record<string, unknown>
  ): Promise<boolean> {
    return data.id === "my-fulfillment-dynamic"
  }
}
```

#### Parameters

<ParameterTypes parameters={[{"name":"data","type":"[ShippingOptionData](../../medusa/types/medusa.ShippingOptionData.mdx)","description":"The `data` object of the shipping option being created. You can use this data to determine whether the shipping option should be calculated or not.\nThis is useful if the fulfillment provider you are integrating has both flat rate and dynamically priced fulfillment options.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}  sectionTitle="canCalculate"/>

#### Returns

<ParameterTypes parameters={[{"name":"Promise","type":"Promise&#60;boolean&#62;","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","description":"If this method returns `true`, that means that the price can be calculated dynamically and the shipping option can have the `price_type` set to calculated.\nThe amount property of the shipping option will then be set to null. The amount will be created later when the shipping method is created on checkout using the [calculatePrice](fulfillment.FulfillmentService.mdx#calculateprice) method.\nIf the method returns `false`, an error is thrown as it means the selected shipping option is invalid and it can only have the `flat_rate` price type.","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"boolean","type":"`boolean`","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","description":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]}  sectionTitle="canCalculate"/>

### calculatePrice

This method is used in different places, including:

1. When the shipping options for a cart are retrieved during checkout. If a shipping option has their `price_type` set to calculated, this method is used to set the amount of the returned shipping option.
2. When a shipping method is created. If the shipping option associated with the method has their `price_type` set to `calculated`, this method is used to set the `price` attribute of the shipping method in the database.
3. When the cart's totals are calculated.

#### Example

An example of calculating the price based on some custom logic:

```ts
class MyFulfillmentService extends AbstractFulfillmentService {
  // ...
  async calculatePrice(
    optionData: Record<string, unknown>,
    data: Record<string, unknown>,
    cart: Cart
  ): Promise<number> {
    return cart.items.length * 1000
  }
}
```

If your fulfillment provider does not provide any dynamically calculated rates you can return any static value or throw an error. For example:

```ts
class MyFulfillmentService extends AbstractFulfillmentService {
  // ...
  async calculatePrice(
    optionData: Record<string, unknown>,
    data: Record<string, unknown>,
    cart: Cart
  ): Promise<number> {
    throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
  }
}
```

### createFulfillment

This method is used when a fulfillment is created for an order, a claim, or a swap.

#### Example

Here is a basic implementation of `createFulfillment` for a fulfillment provider that does not interact with any third-party provider to create the fulfillment:

```ts
class MyFulfillmentService extends AbstractFulfillmentService {
  // ...
  async createFulfillment(
    data: Record<string, unknown>,
    items: LineItem[],
    order: Order,
    fulfillment: Fulfillment
  ) {
    // No data is being sent anywhere
    // No data to be stored in the fulfillment's data object
    return {}
  }
}
```

#### Parameters

#### Returns

<ParameterTypes parameters={[{"name":"Promise","type":"Promise&#60;[FulfillmentProviderData](../../medusa/types/medusa.FulfillmentProviderData.mdx)&#62;","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","description":"The data that will be stored in the `data` attribute of the created fulfillment.","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"FulfillmentProviderData","type":"`Record<string, unknown>`","description":"","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]}  sectionTitle="createFulfillment"/>

### cancelFulfillment

This method is called when a fulfillment is cancelled by the admin. This fulfillment can be for an order, a claim, or a swap.

#### Example

This is the basic implementation of the method for a fulfillment provider that doesn't interact with a third-party provider to cancel the fulfillment:

```ts
class MyFulfillmentService extends FulfillmentService {
  // ...
  async cancelFulfillment(
    fulfillment: Record<string, unknown>
  ): Promise<any> {
    return {}
  }
}
```

#### Parameters

<ParameterTypes parameters={[{"name":"fulfillmentData","type":"[FulfillmentProviderData](../../medusa/types/medusa.FulfillmentProviderData.mdx)","description":"The `data` attribute of the fulfillment being canceled","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}  sectionTitle="cancelFulfillment"/>

#### Returns

<ParameterTypes parameters={[{"name":"Promise","type":"Promise&#60;any&#62;","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","description":"The method isn't expected to return any specific data.","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"any","type":"`any`","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","description":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]}  sectionTitle="cancelFulfillment"/>

### createReturn

Fulfillment providers can also be used to return products. A shipping option can be used for returns if the `is_return` property is true or if an admin creates a Return Shipping Option from the settings.
This method is used when the admin [creates a return request](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#orders\_postordersorderreturns) for an order,
[creates a swap](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#orders\_postordersorderswaps) for an order, or when the
[customer creates a return of their order](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#returns\_postreturns). The fulfillment is created automatically for the order return.

#### Example

This is the basic implementation of the method for a fulfillment provider that does not contact with a third-party provider to fulfill the return:

```ts
class MyFulfillmentService extends AbstractFulfillmentService {
  // ...
  async createReturn(
    returnOrder: CreateReturnType
  ): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
    return {}
  }
}
```

#### Parameters

<ParameterTypes parameters={[{"name":"returnOrder","type":"[CreateReturnType](../../medusa/types/medusa.CreateReturnType.mdx)","description":"the return that the fulfillment is being created for.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}  sectionTitle="createReturn"/>

#### Returns

<ParameterTypes parameters={[{"name":"Promise","type":"Promise&#60;Record&#60;string, unknown&#62;&#62;","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","description":"Used to set the value of the `shipping_data` attribute of the return being created.","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"Record","type":"`Record<string, unknown>`","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","description":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]}  sectionTitle="createReturn"/>

### getFulfillmentDocuments

This method is used to retrieve any documents associated with a fulfillment. This method isn't used by default in the backend, but you can use it for custom use cases such as allowing admins to download these documents.

#### Example

```ts
class MyFulfillmentService extends FulfillmentService {
  // ...
  async getFulfillmentDocuments(
    data: Record<string, unknown>
  ): Promise<any> {
    // assuming you contact a client to
    // retrieve the document
    return this.client.getFulfillmentDocuments()
  }
}
```

#### Parameters

#### Returns

<ParameterTypes parameters={[{"name":"Promise","type":"Promise&#60;any&#62;","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","description":"There are no restrictions on the returned response. If your fulfillment provider doesn't provide this functionality, you can leave the method empty or through an error.","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"any","type":"`any`","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","description":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]}  sectionTitle="getFulfillmentDocuments"/>

### getReturnDocuments

This method is used to retrieve any documents associated with a return. This method isn't used by default in the backend, but you can use it for custom use cases such as allowing admins to download these documents.

#### Example

class MyFulfillmentService extends FulfillmentService {
  // ...
  async getReturnDocuments(
    data: Record<string, unknown>
  ): Promise<any> {
    // assuming you contact a client to
    // retrieve the document
    return this.client.getReturnDocuments()
  }
}
```

#### Parameters

<ParameterTypes parameters={[{"name":"data","type":"`Record<string, unknown>`","description":"The data attribute of the return that you're retrieving the documents for.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}  sectionTitle="getReturnDocuments"/>

#### Returns
