# AdminTaxRatesResource

This class is used to send requests to [Admin Tax Rate API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#tax-rates). All its method
are available in the JS Client under the `medusa.admin.taxRates` property.

All methods in this class require [user authentication](js_client.AdminAuthResource.mdx#createsession).

Each region has at least a default tax rate. Admins can create and manage additional tax rates that can be applied for certain conditions, such as for specific product types.

## Methods

### retrieve

Retrieve a tax rate's details.

#### Example

A simple example that retrieves a tax rate by its ID:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.taxRates.retrieve(taxRateId)
.then(({ tax_rate }) => {
  console.log(tax_rate.id);
})
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.taxRates.retrieve(taxRateId, {
  expand: "shipping_options"
})
.then(({ tax_rate }) => {
  console.log(tax_rate.id);
})
```

### list

Retrieve a list of tax rates. The tax rates can be filtered by fields such as `name` or `rate` passed in the `query` parameter. The tax rates can also be paginated.

#### Example

To list tax rates:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.taxRates.list()
.then(({ tax_rates, limit, offset, count }) => {
  console.log(tax_rates.length);
})
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the tax rates:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.taxRates.list({
  expand: ["shipping_options"]
})
.then(({ tax_rates, limit, offset, count }) => {
  console.log(tax_rates.length);
})
```

By default, only the first `50` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `limit` and `offset` properties:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.taxRates.list({
  expand: ["shipping_options"],
  limit,
  offset
})
.then(({ tax_rates, limit, offset, count }) => {
  console.log(tax_rates.length);
})
```

### removeProducts

Remove products from a tax rate. This only removes the association between the products and the tax rate. It does not delete the products.

#### Example

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.taxRates.removeProducts(taxRateId, {
  products: [
    productId
  ]
})
.then(({ tax_rate }) => {
  console.log(tax_rate.id);
})
```
