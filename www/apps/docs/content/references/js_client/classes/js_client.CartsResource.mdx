### complete

Complete a cart and place an order or create a swap, based on the cart's type. This includes attempting to authorize the cart's payment.
If authorizing the payment requires more action, the cart will not be completed and the order will not be placed or the swap will not be created.
An idempotency key will be generated if none is provided in the header `Idempotency-Key` and added to
the response. If an error occurs during cart completion or the request is interrupted for any reason, the cart completion can be retried by passing the idempotency
key in the `Idempotency-Key` header.

#### Example

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
medusa.carts.complete(cartId)
.then(({ data, type }) => {
  console.log(data.id, type);
})
```

#### Parameters

<ParameterTypes parameters={[{"name":"cart_id","type":"`string`","description":"The ID of the cart to complete.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"customHeaders","type":"`Record<string, any>`","description":"Custom headers to attach to the request.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"{}","expandable":false,"children":[]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/js-client/overview#expanding-fields" sectionTitle="complete"/>

### create

Create a Cart. Although optional, specifying the cart's region and sales channel can affect the cart's pricing and
the products that can be added to the cart respectively. So, make sure to set those early on and change them if necessary, such as when the customer changes their region.
If a customer is logged in, make sure to pass its ID or email within the cart's details so that the cart is attached to the customer.

#### Example

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
medusa.carts.create()
.then(({ cart }) => {
  console.log(cart.id);

### createPaymentSessions

Create Payment Sessions for each of the available Payment Providers in the Cart's Region. If there's only one payment session created,
it will be selected by default. The creation of the payment session uses the payment provider and may require sending requests to third-party services.

#### Example

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
medusa.carts.createPaymentSessions(cartId)
.then(({ cart }) => {
  console.log(cart.id);
})
```

#### Parameters

<ParameterTypes parameters={[{"name":"cart_id","type":"`string`","description":"The ID of the cart to create the payment sessions for.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"customHeaders","type":"`Record<string, any>`","description":"Custom headers to attach to the request.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"{}","expandable":false,"children":[]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/js-client/overview#expanding-fields" sectionTitle="createPaymentSessions"/>

### deleteDiscount

Remove a Discount from a Cart. This only removes the application of the discount, and not completely deletes it. The totals will be re-calculated and the payment sessions
will be refreshed after the removal.

#### Example

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
medusa.carts.deleteDiscount(cartId, code)
.then(({ cart }) => {
  console.log(cart.id);
})
```

#### Parameters

<ParameterTypes parameters={[{"name":"cart_id","type":"`string`","description":"the ID of the cart to remove the discount from.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"code","type":"`string`","description":"The code of the discount to remove from the cart.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"customHeaders","type":"`Record<string, any>`","description":"Custom headers to attach to the request.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"{}","expandable":false,"children":[]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/js-client/overview#expanding-fields" sectionTitle="deleteDiscount"/>

#### Example

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
medusa.carts.update(cartId, {
  email: "user@example.com"
