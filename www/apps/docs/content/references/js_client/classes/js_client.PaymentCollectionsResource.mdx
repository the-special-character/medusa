# PaymentCollectionsResource

This class is used to send requests to [Store Payment Collection API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#payment-collections). All its method
are available in the JS Client under the `medusa.paymentCollections` property.

A payment collection is useful for managing additional payments, such as for Order Edits, or installment payments.

## Methods

A simple example that retrieves a payment collection by its ID:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"

// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.paymentCollections.retrieve(paymentCollectionId)
.then(({ payment_collection }) => {
  console.log(payment_collection.id)
})
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.paymentCollections.retrieve(paymentCollectionId, {
  expand: "region"
})
.then(({ payment_collection }) => {
  console.log(payment_collection.id)
})
```

### managePaymentSessionsBatch

Create, update, or delete a list of payment sessions of a Payment Collections. If a payment session is not provided in the `sessions` array, it's deleted.

#### Example

To add two new payment sessions:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token

// Total amount = 10000
medusa.paymentCollections.managePaymentSessionsBatch(paymentId, {
  sessions: [
    {
      provider_id: "stripe",
      amount: 5000,
    },
    {
      provider_id: "manual",
      amount: 5000,
    },
  ]
})
.then(({ payment_collection }) => {
  console.log(payment_collection.id);
})
```

To update a payment session and another one by not including it in the payload:

```ts
medusa.paymentCollections.managePaymentSessionsBatch(paymentId, {
  sessions: [
    {
      provider_id: "stripe",
      amount: 10000,
      session_id: "ps_123456"
    },
  ]
})
.then(({ payment_collection }) => {
  console.log(payment_collection.id);
})
```
