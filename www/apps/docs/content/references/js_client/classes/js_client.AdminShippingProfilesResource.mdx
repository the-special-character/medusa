# AdminShippingProfilesResource

This class is used to send requests to [Admin Shipping Profile API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#shipping-profiles). All its method
are available in the JS Client under the `medusa.admin.shippingProfiles` property.

A shipping profile is used to group products that can be shipped in the same manner.
They are created by the admin and they're not associated with a fulfillment provider.
