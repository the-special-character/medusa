### list

Retrieve a list of product collections. The product collections can be filtered by fields such as `handle` or `title`. The collections can also be sorted or paginated.

#### Example

To list product collections:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.collections.list()
.then(({ collections, limit, offset, count }) => {
  console.log(collections.length);
})
```

By default, only the first `10` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `limit` and `offset` properties:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.collections.list({
  limit,
  offset
})
.then(({ collections, limit, offset, count }) => {
  console.log(collections.length);
})
```

### removeProducts

Remove a list of products from a collection. This would not delete the product, only the association between the product and the collection.

#### Example

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.collections.removeProducts(collectionId, {
  product_ids: [
    productId1,
    productId2
  ]
})
.then(({ id, object, removed_products }) => {
  console.log(removed_products)
})
