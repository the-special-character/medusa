# Swaps

Queries and Mutations listed here are used to send requests to the [Store Swap API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#swaps).

A swap is created by a customer or an admin to exchange an item with a new one.
Creating a swap implicitely includes creating a return for the item being exchanged.

## Mutations

### useCreateSwap

This hook creates a Swap for an Order. This will also create a return and associate it with the swap. If a return shipping option is specified, the return will automatically be fulfilled.
To complete the swap, you must use the [useCompleteCart](medusa_react.Hooks.Store.Carts.mdx#usecompletecart) hook passing it the ID of the swap's cart.

An idempotency key will be generated if none is provided in the header `Idempotency-Key` and added to
the response. If an error occurs during swap creation or the request is interrupted for any reason, the swap creation can be retried by passing the idempotency
key in the `Idempotency-Key` header.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { useCreateSwap } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  orderId: string
}

type CreateData = {
  return_items: {
    item_id: string
    quantity: number
  }[]
  additional_items: {
    variant_id: string
    quantity: number
  }[]
  return_shipping_option: string
}

const CreateSwap = ({
  orderId
}: Props) => {
  const createSwap = useCreateSwap()
  // ...

  const handleCreate = (
    data: CreateData
  ) => {
    createSwap.mutate({
      ...data,
      order_id: orderId
    }, {
      onSuccess: ({ swap }) => {
        console.log(swap.id)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default CreateSwap
```
