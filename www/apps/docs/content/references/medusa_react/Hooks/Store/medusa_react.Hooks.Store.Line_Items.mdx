# Line Items

Mutations listed here are used to send requests to the Line Item API Routes part of the [Store Cart API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#carts).

The hooks listed have general examples on how to use them, but it's highly recommended to use the [CartProvider](../../Providers/medusa_react.Providers.Cart.mdx#cartprovider) provider and
the [useCart](../../Providers/medusa_react.Providers.Cart.mdx#usecart) hook to manage your cart and access the current cart across your application.

## Mutations

### useCreateLineItem

This hook generates a Line Item with a given Product Variant and adds it to the Cart.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { useCreateLineItem } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  cartId: string
}

const Cart = ({ cartId }: Props) => {
  const createLineItem = useCreateLineItem(cartId)

  const handleAddItem = (
    variantId: string,
    quantity: number
  ) => {
    createLineItem.mutate({
      variant_id: variantId,
      quantity,
    }, {
      onSuccess: ({ cart }) => {
        console.log(cart.items)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default Cart
```
