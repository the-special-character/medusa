# Tax Rates

Queries and Mutations listed here are used to send requests to the [Admin Tax Rate API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#tax-rates).

All hooks listed require [user authentication](medusa_react.Hooks.Admin.Auth.mdx#useadminlogin).

Each region has at least a default tax rate. Admins can create and manage additional tax rates that can be applied for certain conditions, such as for specific product types.

type Props = {
  regionId: string
}

const CreateTaxRate = ({ regionId }: Props) => {
  const createTaxRate = useAdminCreateTaxRate()
  // ...

  const handleCreate = (
    code: string,
    name: string,
    rate: number
  ) => {
    createTaxRate.mutate({
      code,
      name,
      region_id: regionId,
      rate,
    }, {
      onSuccess: ({ tax_rate }) => {
        console.log(tax_rate.id)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default CreateTaxRate
```

  const deleteTaxRate = useAdminDeleteTaxRate(taxRateId)
  // ...

  const handleDelete = () => {
    deleteTaxRate.mutate(void 0, {
      onSuccess: ({ id, object, deleted }) => {
        console.log(id)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default TaxRate
```

### useAdminDeleteProductTaxRates

This hook removes products from a tax rate. This only removes the association between the products and the tax rate. It does not delete the products.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { useAdminDeleteProductTaxRates } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  taxRateId: string
}

const TaxRate = ({ taxRateId }: Props) => {
  const removeProduct = useAdminDeleteProductTaxRates(taxRateId)
  // ...

  const handleRemoveProduct = (productIds: string[]) => {
    removeProduct.mutate({
      products: productIds,
    }, {
      onSuccess: ({ tax_rate }) => {
        console.log(tax_rate.products)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default TaxRate
```

### useAdminDeleteProductTypeTaxRates

This hook removes product types from a tax rate. This only removes the association between the 
product types and the tax rate. It does not delete the product types.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { 
  useAdminDeleteProductTypeTaxRates,
} from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  taxRateId: string
}

const TaxRate = ({ taxRateId }: Props) => {
  const removeProductTypes = useAdminDeleteProductTypeTaxRates(
    taxRateId
  )
  // ...

  const handleRemoveProductTypes = (
    productTypeIds: string[]
  ) => {
    removeProductTypes.mutate({
      product_types: productTypeIds,
    }, {
      onSuccess: ({ tax_rate }) => {
        console.log(tax_rate.product_types)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default TaxRate
```

#### Hook Parameters

<ParameterTypes parameters={[{"name":"id","type":"`string`","description":"The tax rate's ID.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/medusa-react/overview#expanding-fields" sectionTitle="useAdminDeleteProductTypeTaxRates"/>

#### Mutation Function Parameters

### useAdminDeleteShippingTaxRates

This hook removes shipping options from a tax rate. This only removes the association between 
the shipping options and the tax rate. It does not delete the shipping options.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { useAdminDeleteShippingTaxRates } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  taxRateId: string
}

const TaxRate = ({ taxRateId }: Props) => {
  const removeShippingOptions = useAdminDeleteShippingTaxRates(
    taxRateId
  )
  // ...

  const handleRemoveShippingOptions = (
    shippingOptionIds: string[]
  ) => {
    removeShippingOptions.mutate({
      shipping_options: shippingOptionIds,
    }, {
      onSuccess: ({ tax_rate }) => {
        console.log(tax_rate.shipping_options)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default TaxRate
```

passed in the `query` parameter. The tax rates can also be paginated.

#### Example

To list tax rates:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminTaxRates } from "medusa-react"

const TaxRates = () => {
  const { 
    tax_rates, 
    isLoading
  } = useAdminTaxRates()

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {tax_rates && !tax_rates.length && (
        <span>No Tax Rates</span>
      )}
      {tax_rates && tax_rates.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {tax_rates.map((tax_rate) => (
            <li key={tax_rate.id}>{tax_rate.code}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default TaxRates
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the tax rates:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminTaxRates } from "medusa-react"

const TaxRates = () => {
  const { 
    tax_rates, 
    isLoading
  } = useAdminTaxRates({
    expand: ["shipping_options"]
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {tax_rates && !tax_rates.length && (
        <span>No Tax Rates</span>
      )}
      {tax_rates && tax_rates.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {tax_rates.map((tax_rate) => (
            <li key={tax_rate.id}>{tax_rate.code}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default TaxRates
```

By default, only the first `50` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `limit` and `offset` properties:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminTaxRates } from "medusa-react"

const TaxRates = () => {
  const { 
    tax_rates, 
    limit,
    offset,
    isLoading
  } = useAdminTaxRates({
    expand: ["shipping_options"],
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {tax_rates && !tax_rates.length && (
        <span>No Tax Rates</span>
      )}
      {tax_rates && tax_rates.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {tax_rates.map((tax_rate) => (
            <li key={tax_rate.id}>{tax_rate.code}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default TaxRates
```

### useAdminTaxRate

This hook retrieves a tax rate's details.

#### Example

A simple example that retrieves a tax rate by its ID:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminTaxRate } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  taxRateId: string
}

const TaxRate = ({ taxRateId }: Props) => {
  const { tax_rate, isLoading } = useAdminTaxRate(taxRateId)

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {tax_rate && <span>{tax_rate.code}</span>}
    </div>
  )
}

export default TaxRate
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminTaxRate } from "medusa-react"

const TaxRate = (taxRateId: string) => {
  const { tax_rate, isLoading } = useAdminTaxRate(taxRateId, {
    expand: ["shipping_options"]
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {tax_rate && <span>{tax_rate.code}</span>}
    </div>
  )
}

export default TaxRate
```
