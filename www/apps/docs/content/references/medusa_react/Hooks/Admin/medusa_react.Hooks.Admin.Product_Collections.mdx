# Product Collections

Queries and Mutations listed here are used to send requests to the [Admin Product Collection API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#product-collections).

All hooks listed require [user authentication](medusa_react.Hooks.Admin.Auth.mdx#useadminlogin).

A product collection is used to organize products for different purposes such as marketing or discount purposes. For example, you can create a Summer Collection.

## Mutations

### useAdminCreateCollection

  const handleCreate = (title: string) => {
    createCollection.mutate({
      title
    }, {
      onSuccess: ({ collection }) => {
        console.log(collection.id)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default CreateCollection
```

### useAdminRemoveProductsFromCollection

This hook removes a list of products from a collection. This would not delete the product, 
only the association between the product and the collection.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { useAdminRemoveProductsFromCollection } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  collectionId: string
}

const Collection = ({ collectionId }: Props) => {
  const removeProducts = useAdminRemoveProductsFromCollection(collectionId)
  // ...

  const handleRemoveProducts = (productIds: string[]) => {
    removeProducts.mutate({
      product_ids: productIds
    }, {
      onSuccess: ({ id, object, removed_products }) => {
        console.log(removed_products)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default Collection
```

#### Hook Parameters

## Queries

### useAdminCollections

This hook retrieves a list of product collections. The product collections can be filtered by fields such as `handle` or `title`.
The collections can also be sorted or paginated.

#### Example

To list product collections:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminCollections } from "medusa-react"

const Collections = () => {
  const { collections, isLoading } = useAdminCollections()

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {collections && !collections.length && <span>
        No Product Collections
      </span>}
      {collections && collections.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {collections.map((collection) => (
            <li key={collection.id}>{collection.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Collections
```

By default, only the first `10` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `limit` and `offset` properties:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminCollections } from "medusa-react"

const Collections = () => {
  const { collections, limit, offset, isLoading } = useAdminCollections({
    limit: 15,
    offset: 0
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {collections && !collections.length && <span>
        No Product Collections
      </span>}
      {collections && collections.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {collections.map((collection) => (
            <li key={collection.id}>{collection.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Collections
```
