    orderId
  )
  // ...

  const handleCancel = () => {
    cancelOrder.mutate(void 0, {
      onSuccess: ({ order }) => {

type Props = {
  orderId: string
}

const Order = ({ orderId }: Props) => {
  const capturePayment = useAdminCapturePayment(
    orderId
  )
  // ...

  const handleCapture = () => {
    capturePayment.mutate(void 0, {
      onSuccess: ({ order }) => {
        console.log(order.status)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

### useAdminCreateShipment

This hook creates a shipment and mark a fulfillment as shipped. This changes the order's fulfillment status to either 
`partially_shipped` or `shipped`, depending on whether all the items were shipped.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { useAdminCreateShipment } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  orderId: string
}

const Order = ({ orderId }: Props) => {
  const createShipment = useAdminCreateShipment(
    orderId
  )
  // ...

  const handleCreate = (
    fulfillmentId: string
  ) => {
    createShipment.mutate({
      fulfillment_id: fulfillmentId,
    }, {
      onSuccess: ({ order }) => {
        console.log(order.fulfillment_status)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default Order
```

### useAdminAddShippingMethod

This hook adds a shipping method to an order. If another shipping method exists with the same shipping profile, the previous shipping method will be replaced.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { useAdminAddShippingMethod } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  orderId: string
}

const Order = ({ orderId }: Props) => {
  const addShippingMethod = useAdminAddShippingMethod(
    orderId
  )
  // ...

  const handleAddShippingMethod = (
    optionId: string,
    price: number
  ) => {
    addShippingMethod.mutate({
      option_id: optionId,
      price
    }, {
      onSuccess: ({ order }) => {
        console.log(order.shipping_methods)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

## Queries

### useAdminOrders

This hook retrieves a list of orders. The orders can be filtered by fields such as `status` or `display_id` passed 
in the `query` parameter. The order can also be paginated.

#### Example

To list orders:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminOrders } from "medusa-react"

const Orders = () => {
  const { orders, isLoading } = useAdminOrders()

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {orders && !orders.length && <span>No Orders</span>}
      {orders && orders.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {orders.map((order) => (
            <li key={order.id}>{order.display_id}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Orders
```

You can use the `query` parameter to pass filters and specify relations that should be retrieved within the orders. In addition,
By default, only the first `50` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `limit` and `offset` properties:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminOrders } from "medusa-react"

const Orders = () => {
  const { 
    orders,
    limit,
    offset,
    isLoading
  } = useAdminOrders({
    expand: "customers",
    limit: 20,
    offset: 0
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {orders && !orders.length && <span>No Orders</span>}
      {orders && orders.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {orders.map((order) => (
            <li key={order.id}>{order.display_id}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Orders
```

### useAdminOrder

This hook retrieve an order's details.

#### Example

A simple example that retrieves an order by its ID:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminOrder } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  orderId: string
}

const Order = ({ orderId }: Props) => {
  const { 
    order, 
    isLoading, 
  } = useAdminOrder(orderId)

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {order && <span>{order.display_id}</span>}
      
    </div>
  )
}

export default Order
```

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminOrder } from "medusa-react"

const Order = (

) => {
  const { 
    order, 
    isLoading, 
  } = useAdminOrder(orderId, {
    expand: "customer"
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {order && <span>{order.display_id}</span>}
      
    </div>
