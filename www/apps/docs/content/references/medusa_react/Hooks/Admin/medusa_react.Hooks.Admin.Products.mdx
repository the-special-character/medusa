# Products

Queries and Mutations listed here are used to send requests to the [Admin Product API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#products).

All hooks listed require [user authentication](medusa_react.Hooks.Admin.Auth.mdx#useadminlogin).

Products are saleable items in a store. This also includes [saleable gift cards](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/gift-cards/admin/manage-gift-cards#manage-gift-card-product) in a store.

## Mutations

### useAdminCreateProduct

This hook creates a new Product. This hook can also be used to create a gift card if the `is_giftcard` field is set to `true`.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { useAdminCreateProduct } from "medusa-react"

type CreateProductData = {
  title: string
  is_giftcard: boolean
  discountable: boolean
  options: {
    title: string
  }[]
  variants: {
    title: string
    prices: {
      amount: number
      currency_code :string
    }[]
    options: {
      value: string
    }[]
  }[],
  collection_id: string
  categories: {
    id: string
  }[]
  type: {
    value: string
  }
  tags: {
    value: string
  }[]
}

const CreateProduct = () => {
  const createProduct = useAdminCreateProduct()
  // ...

  const handleCreate = (productData: CreateProductData) => {
    createProduct.mutate(productData, {
      onSuccess: ({ product }) => {
        console.log(product.id)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default CreateProduct
```

### useAdminDeleteProductOption

This hook deletes a product option. If there are product variants that use this product option, 
they must be deleted before deleting the product option.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { useAdminDeleteProductOption } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  productId: string
  optionId: string
}

const ProductOption = ({
  productId,
  optionId
}: Props) => {
  const deleteOption = useAdminDeleteProductOption(
    productId
  )
  // ...

  const handleDelete = () => {
    deleteOption.mutate(optionId, {
      onSuccess: ({ option_id, object, deleted, product }) => {
        console.log(product.options)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default ProductOption
```

## Queries

### useAdminProducts

This hook retrieves a list of products. The products can be filtered by fields such as `q` or `status` passed in 
the `query` parameter. The products can also be sorted or paginated.

#### Example

To list products:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminProducts } from "medusa-react"

const Products = () => {
  const { products, isLoading } = useAdminProducts()

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {products && !products.length && <span>No Products</span>}
      {products && products.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {products.map((product) => (
            <li key={product.id}>{product.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Products
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the products:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminProducts } from "medusa-react"

const Products = () => {
  const { products, isLoading } = useAdminProducts({
    expand: "images"
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {products && !products.length && <span>No Products</span>}
      {products && products.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {products.map((product) => (
            <li key={product.id}>{product.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Products
```

By default, only the first `50` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `limit` and `offset` properties:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminProducts } from "medusa-react"

const Products = () => {
  const { 
    products, 
    limit,
    offset,
    isLoading
  } = useAdminProducts({
    expand: "images",
    limit: 20,
    offset: 0
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {products && !products.length && <span>No Products</span>}
      {products && products.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {products.map((product) => (
            <li key={product.id}>{product.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Products
```

      {tags && !tags.length && <span>No Product Tags</span>}
      {tags && tags.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {tags.map((tag) => (
            <li key={tag.id}>{tag.value} - {tag.usage_count}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
